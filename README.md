# codeintel-Timing-Attack-Analyzer
Identifies potential timing attack vulnerabilities by analyzing the execution time of code blocks. This could be implemented by instrumenting code with timing measurements and identifying code blocks where the execution time is correlated with secret data. - Focused on Tools for static code analysis, vulnerability scanning, and code quality assurance
